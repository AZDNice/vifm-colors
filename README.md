Various colorschemes for [vifm](http://vifm.sourceforge.net/).
- Solarized Dark
- Zenburn

The solarized-dark theme is based on [istib](https://github.com/istib)'s [version](https://github.com/istib/dotfiles/blob/master/vifm/vifm-colors).

Load with `:colorscheme theme-name` in vifm, or write `colorscheme theme-name` in vifm's configuration file `~/.vifm/vifmrc`.

If you have any color themes that are not in this repo, feel free to fork, add it and send me a pull request!
